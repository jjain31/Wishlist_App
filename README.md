# To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. It also saves the tasks to `localStorage` so that they persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to the list by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on the checkbox next to each task.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete button (represented by a trash icon) next to each task.
- **Persistent Storage:** The tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so they persist between page reloads.
